# Digital-Wardrobe Application (Playground for creating outfits)

I developed this project during my graduation from Spiced Academy Berlin. It was my first experience with full-stack development, from ideation to presentation at Demo Day. The platform allows users to play with outfits using separate clothing items.

## Background

The project was an amazing experience that honed various skills, including researching ideas, choosing technologies, collaborating with peers and teachers, and implementing challenging features. The motivation behind this application stemmed from my personal creativity and passion for fashion, making everyday outfits enjoyable.
